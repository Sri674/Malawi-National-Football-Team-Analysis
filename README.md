# Malawi-National-Football-Team-Analysis 

📌 Aim of the Project

        To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Malawi National Football Team's historical match data in order to uncover performance patterns, such as
        
   win/loss trends, opponent analysis, venue impact, and goal statistics. 

🎯 Objectives of the Project

       1) To understand the overall performance of the Malawi football team.
       
       2) To identify the team's strongest and weakest opponents.
       
       3) To analyze performance differences based on match venues (Home, Away, Neutral).
       
       4) To determine in which competitions the team performs best. 
       
       5) To find goal-scoring trends across different opponents and competitions. 
       
       6) To visualize the team's result distribution (Win, Loss, Draw). 

🛠️ Steps Followed in the Project 

1) Data Collection:

        > Used a dataset containing Malawi’s football match history, including opponent, result, venue, competition, and goals.

2) Data Cleaning:

        > Removed missing or irrelevant entries.

        > Ensured consistent formatting in column names and values.

3) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

   * Used groupby(), value_counts(), and visualizations to analyze:

       > Number of wins, losses, and draws per opponent.
       
       > Venue-wise performance (home vs away).
       
       > Most goals scored in which competitions.
       
       > Most frequent Opponents (via bar charts).
       
       > Count of Matches by Venue
       
       > Distributions of Team Score and Opponent Scores.
       
       > Matches played per year.
       
       > Draw, win, and loss counts using bar plots.

4) Visualization Tools Used:

       > matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn.

       > Bar plots, stacked bar charts for comparing performance categories.

✅ Conclusion

      * The Malawi team has its highest number of wins against Comoros.

      * It suffers most losses against Senegal, Ghana, and Egypt.

      * Mozambique, Namibia, and Kenya are teams with whom Malawi frequently draws. 

      * The team’s performance varies significantly based on opponent and venue. 

      * Malawi team have most number of wins at their Home Venue.

      * Most goals scored by Malawi team in AFCON Qualifier Competition.

      * The EDA approach was sufficient to derive meaningful insights without needing machine learning predictions. 

      * This project demonstrates how data-driven storytelling and visualization can help analyze sports team performance effectively. 

📈 Future Scope of the Project 

    Advanced Predictive Modeling: Extend the analysis by building more sophisticated machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks) to                                    predict match outcomes.
